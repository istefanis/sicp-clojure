# sicp-clojure

My solutions to exercises of the CS textbook ['Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs', 2nd edition, MIT Press](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp), by H. Abelson and G. J. Sussman with J. Sussman, written in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/).

## Organization

* Each `src` file is self-contained, and deals with either one or multiple related exercises
* Tests are included in the `test` directory

Currently only Chapter 1 and few Chapter 2 solutions and tests are uploaded (but I expect to add more). Any corrections or  enhancements are welcome. Have fun!
